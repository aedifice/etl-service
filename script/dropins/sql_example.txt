-- Add a description for what your command does. 
-- Comments can span multiple lines and start with "-- ". Certain special lines, 
-- like the source, also start with "-- ". These lines provide configuration details. 

-- Commands must include a source: what sort of parser should we use for the command? 
-- This example retrieves data from a MySQL instance, so its source is "mysql". 
-- @source mysql

-- The command itself is a standard SQL query.
