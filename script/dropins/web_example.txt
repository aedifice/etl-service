-- Add a description for what your command does.
-- Comments can span multiple lines and start with "-- ". Certain special lines,
-- like the source, also start with "-- ". These lines provide configuration details.

-- Commands must include a source: what sort of parser should we use for the command?
-- This example retrieves data from an API, so its source is "webservice".
-- @source webservice

-- When we retrieve data from a webservice, we must provide a line that contains
-- the ACTION and URL. For example, we want to GET data from Open Library.
-- Do I use Open Library a lot for my examples? Yes, yes I do.
GET https://openlibrary.org/books/OL31834369M.json

-- Any additional lines can be used to configure headers, like specifying that
-- we expect a JSON value in return.
